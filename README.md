- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @FedeGue, an expert on non expertise
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learn how to become a proud data analyst
- Iâ€™m currently learning just the basics. I really love C
-  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on fun projects that can test my problem solving more than my competency (that for the moment is really poor)


- Fun fact: I'm a Hystory PhD Student! (hopefully i will defend my thesis in July, wish me luck). I'm also an avid learner and reader AND, I'm working to become a Personal Trainer.
